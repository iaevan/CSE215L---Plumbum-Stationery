## Stationery Shop Sales and POS System

CSE215L.13
PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE II LAB

The project is a JavaFX application designed to simulate the operations of a stationery shop. The application can be used by 3 types of users, Admin, Salesperson and Customer. It allows the customer to purchase the product that they want, the salesperson to conduct the sell in a POS-like manner, and it gives the admin almost full control over the shopâ€™s data.

The Application was designed using an object oriented approach. The GUI was created using JavaFX and SceneBuilder. Separate controller classes were implemented for each view to handle user interactions and application logic.

Due to the restriction on using any database or ArrayList, normal arrays was used to store data and managing objects. The `DataStorage` class works as the central database of the entire program
